# Data Structures Practice Problems

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental data structure problems and algorithms. All code follows industry-standard coding practices and has been validated through automated linting and testing pipelines.

## Code Quality Standards

### PEP 8 Compliance
All Python code in this repository adheres to **PEP 8** (Python Enhancement Proposal 8), the official Python style guide that defines the coding standards for Python code. Key PEP 8 standards followed:

- **Naming Conventions**: Functions and variables use `snake_case`, classes use `PascalCase`
- **Line Length**: Code lines are limited to 79 characters for optimal readability
- **Indentation**: Consistent 4-space indentation
- **Imports**: Organized with standard library imports first, then third-party, then local imports
- **Whitespace**: Proper spacing around operators, after commas, and around brackets

### Pylint Validation
Code has been validated using **Pylint**, a static code analysis tool for Python that checks for:

- **Code Quality**: Detects potential bugs, code smells, and poor practices
- **Coding Standards**: Ensures PEP 8 compliance and consistent style
- **Refactoring Opportunities**: Identifies complex code that could be simplified
- **Documentation**: Checks for proper docstrings and comments

### Industry Readiness

The codebase meets **enterprise-grade standards** as validated by our course CI/CD pipeline:

- ✅ **Linting**: All code passes Pylint checks with high scores
- ✅ **Code Style**: Consistent formatting and naming conventions
- ✅ **Documentation**: Clear comments and docstrings where needed
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling patterns
- ✅ **Performance**: Efficient algorithm implementations
- ✅ **Testing**: Code structure supports automated testing

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installing Linting Tools

```bash
# Install pylint for code quality checking
pip install pylint

# Install flake8 for additional style checking (optional)
pip install flake8

# Install black for code formatting (optional)
pip install black
```

### Running Linters Locally

```bash
# Check all Python files with pylint
pylint *.py

# Check specific file
pylint q1.py

# Format code with black (optional)
black *.py

# Check with flake8 (optional)
flake8 *.py
```

### Expected Pylint Scores
- **8.0+**: Excellent code quality
- **7.0-8.0**: Good code quality
- **6.0-7.0**: Acceptable with minor improvements needed

## Coding Best Practices Implemented

### 1. **Modular Design**
- Each problem is contained in its own file
- Functions are focused on single responsibilities
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. **Documentation**
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Function docstrings where appropriate
- Clear variable naming

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Appropriate exception handling
- Input validation where necessary
- Graceful error messages

### 4. **Performance Considerations**
- Efficient algorithm choices
- Appropriate data structure selection
- Time/space complexity awareness

## Course Pipeline Validation

This codebase has been tested and validated through our automated course pipeline:

- **Static Analysis**: Pylint and code quality checks
- **Style Enforcement**: PEP 8 compliance validation
- **Syntax Validation**: Python syntax correctness
- **Import Validation**: Proper module imports and dependencies

## Contributing

### For Course Submission
1. Ensure all code passes local linting: `pylint *.py`
2. Test your solutions thoroughly
3. Commit with clear, descriptive messages
4. Push to your branch and create a merge request
